## 1.0-alpha4

### Base theme

- **Possible incompatible change.** Removed ds-reset layout.
- Added default layout templates with corrected markup.
- **Incompatible change**. Refactoring all templates and markup to satisfy [Drupal 8 CSS architecture](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/css/css-architecture-for-drupal-8) (OOCSS).
- Fixed previously added suggestions for paragraphs:
  - paragraph--{ID}--{VIEW_MODE}.html.twig
  - paragraph--{ID}.html.twig
- Added suggestion to block content type:
  - block--{BLOCK_TYPE}.html.twig
- Slightly updated logo colors. For base theme and starter the svg logo is now contains objects, not the text because of font face that can be missed on systems.
- Added new templates from stable theme.
- **Possible incompatible change.** Added default **commerce-product.html.twig** template.
- Added `data-hook-suggestion` for input fields support.

### Starter theme

- Added new variable `$input-color` and added to inputs.
- Class naming according to OOCSS.
- All base styles was reworked to respect refactoring to OOCSS.
- Installed `gulp-sass-glob` and updated gulpfile to use it.
- SCSS folder is restructured for `gulp-sass-glob`. Now we have only one import file `styles.scss`, there are no more `_all.scss` inside any folder! You can now just create new `_file.scss` and it will be compiled! The splitting for components and base style to `_styles.scss`, `_variables.scss` and `_mixins.scss` is now removed and they are in a single file. This is done because gulp-sass-glob can't respect order and it will crash. The auto-include is much preferable than this splitting.
- Breadcrumbs is now responsive by default.
- Added PostCSS.
- `gulp-autoprefixier` replaced by `autoprefixier` from PostCSS.
- SUSY is removed, to replace it added [Lost Grid](http://lostgrid.org) for PostCSS.
- Added templates for local actions.
- Many of elements reworked and restyled.
- Added SCSS function `color-level()` with same functionality as `theme-color-level()`.

- Added information about [SCSS architecture](docs/scss-architecture.md) in this theme.
- Removed default README.md files from scss folders.
- `/assets/scss/base/typography` was improved and reworked. Added new variables, edited old, some styles were removed to follow rules of base folder.
- Added new variable `$gray-50` and color for it.
- All gray colors was replaced with material design gray palette.

- Material Design Icons is now default icon font in theme. FontAwesome dependency were removed and added documentation how to take them back.

## 1.0-alpha2

### Base theme

No changes has been made.

### Starter theme

- Button component base style moved from `.button` class to placeholder `%button`. This is more flexible solution because of `@extend .class` can broke in some behaviors with ordering.
- In `/assets/utilities/_all.scss` function and variables is swapped. Function is now has higher priority. It's allow to use functions inside variables.
- Colors like `$ui-site-color-1` and so forth is replaced by single variable -colors which is array.
- Added new function `theme-color()`. This functions return color by his key from -colors array. Bootstrap alike.
- Added new function `theme-color-level()`. This function returns color mixing by his key and level. 0 - is the same color, negative values will desature color, positive is opposite. Bootstrap alike.
- All base colors variables was replaced by functions.
- Added new color map `$grays` with gray colors. Bootstrap alike.
- Added new function `gray()`. Returns gray color by his key. Bootstrap alike.
- All old `$gray-*` variables were replaced by `gray()` function.
- Added `$colors` variable for all others colors. Bootstrap alike.
- Added new function `color()`. Returns color by his key. Bootstrap alike.
- Some default colors were replaced by new `color()` function.
- `color-contrast()` function is renamed to `color-yiq()`.
- Added two new variables `$yiq-text-dark` and `$yiq-text-light`. They used in `color-yiq()` function as default values.
- Pointless readme files in assets folder, which created for keep folders in repo were removed and replaced by hidden files `.gitkeep`.
- `base/_base.scss` is moved to personal folder `base/global`.
- Added variables to control focus outline and set default value. It's [bad practice](http://www.outlinenone.com) to ignore them, so they are back now!
- `base/_typography.scss` is moved to personal folder `base/typography`.
- Added !default to all variables. They now overridable in external files.
- Cleaned utilities directory.
- Variables is now has several files. By default `_global.scss` to all global default variables and `_custom.scss` with your overridden variables and new ones. You still can edit variables directly, because it's all in your custom theme and can't brake anything else. All depends on your preferences.

## 1.0-alpha1

First initial release with version. For now, I am satisfied by theme at most. Some things can change, but from now on, I'll be track them in that file. I still no recommend to use it without understand the consequences. 

Since release of first alpha, now we can use composer to lock theme version, and I recommend to do that. Because theme is a little bit tricky to maintain. Just single changed class in base theme can create a lot of pain after update. So be careful.

- Added CHANGELOG.md to track all changes.
- Changed composer.json for theme to be `drupal-theme` instead of being `drupal-custom-theme`.
