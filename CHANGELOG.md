## [2.0-alpha1]

This is a small release that is mostly equals to 8.x-1.0-alpha21.

### Base theme

- Updated README file.

## Starter theme

- Removed STARTER_SCSS. I'm no longer use SCSS for a more than year, I don't want to support 'dead' starter. There is no any reason in it, since the PostCSS does the same and closer to a vanialla CSS. If you still need it, it downs to rename *.pcss to *.scss and replace PostCSS watcher with SASS compiler.
- STARTER_PCSS is now STARTER.
