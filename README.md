*  SCSS preprocessor for better CSS experience.
*  Susy for creating website much faster with flexible grids.
*  FontAwesome for using SVG icons.
*  Breakpoint for making your site responsive.
*  Drupal 8 CSS standarts.
*  Good structure.
*  Predefined DisplaySuite layouts.
*  Clear Views templates with more semantic code (footer, section, header).
*  Flexbox mixins with old syntax support.

Due of the theme structure, where all parts are separated of each other, you can disable most of them without any pain and consequences, just remove import line and delete files. Theme is highly customazible and you can easly replace any part of it by your needs.
