   Base theme for Drupal with starterkit.
 </p>
</p>

## Features

- **Modern CSS**, which includes **CSS variables** for styling and **CSS grids** for layouts!
- Two starter themes:
  - **SCSS:** The [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) based starter theme.
  - **PostCSS:** The [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) based starter theme. This one will give you full control over your styles and when they must be attached.
- [ITCSS architecture](https://github.com/ahmadajmi/awesome-itcss) for style structure. If you're not familiar with ITCSS, it's recommended to watch [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4&feature=youtu.be&t=524) by Harry Roberts (@csswizardry) to get inspired.
- [BEM methodology](https://bem.info/) for template class naming. In [variation](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) of Harry Roberts (@csswizardry) as well.

The theme provides only a basic styles for HTML elements (and some Drupal specific ones), a small set of tools and a pre-organized structure. This means that you need to design the site and connect all the necessary libraries and extensions by yourself. It's a price for the flexibility and freedom that a theme gives you. It's a canvas with some important brushes.
