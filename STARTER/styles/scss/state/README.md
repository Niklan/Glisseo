# State

State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in different views like the home page or the inside page.
*  Custom classes, often but not always applied via JavaScript. These should be prefixed with .is-, e.g. .is-transitioning, .is-open;
*  pseudo-classes, such as :hover and :checked;
*  HTML attributes with state semantics, such as details[open];
*  media queries: styles that alter appearance based on the immediate browser environment.
