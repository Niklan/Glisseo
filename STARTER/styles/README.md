For compile to css, you must use:

~~~
sass --watch scss:css
~~~

# Gulp

If you have gulp on your server or vanilla sass compile is pain for you (very slow), you can use gulpfile.js

To use this feature you must have nodejs on your server and install packages:

~~~
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g gulp-sass
~~~

Then move to theme root folder and use it:

~~~
gulp watch
~~~
